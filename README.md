# Mentaliseren_Client
Unity 2020 project of the Mentaliseren project. This is the client section using OpenXR

This is the complete Unity 2020.3.37 version of the Mentaliseren Client component as made by the Tech Labs of the Network Institute. This component is meant to be used together with the Meta Quest 2 Mentaliseren Server application (https://github.com/networkinstitutevu/Mentaliseren_Server). This client is meant to run on a Meta Quest 2 HMD with a basic Internet connection (http requests over port 80). This compnent is meant to be used by the participant talking-aloud to the avatar that is visible. This version uses a dedicated web service and needs to be changed to any other http service to be useful. The PHP code is available in the server repos.
Note that some licensed assets are removed from this project (see <Unity Assets Removed>. To fully recreate this project you will need to purchase these objects and restore them to the scene.
Please also note that there is a hard coded number that designates which Quest unit this is. The server side uses this number to connect to the correct Quest HMD.

Use this software -as is-.
